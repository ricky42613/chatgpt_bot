# chatgpt_bot
* Note1: This version only test on chatgpt plus account.
* Note2: Professor didn't tell me that I need to share this extension to labmate, so I ignore the maintenance and user experience when I develop it. If the extension has some inconvinient part, I'm sorry about that but cannot fix it before I have oral defense.
# Some part you need to modify by yourself
